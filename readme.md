# Rust Axum Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for rust Axum web framework.

## Features

- Rust integration
- Axum integration
- Typed Multipart integration
- Validation integration
- Cache integration
- Error handling integration
- Logger integration
- Environment variables integration
- Configuration file integration
- Formatting with rustfmt

## To run and intall dependencies

```
cargo run
```

## To Watch and run

```
cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x run
```

## To Build

```
cargo build
```

## Diesel command

```sh
diesel migration run
diesel migration redo
diesel migration generate <migration_name>
diesel migration create create_your_table_name
diesel print-schema > src/schema/table.rs
```

## Features to add

- Add transactions contacts
- Add transactions remitance
- Add transactions conversion

Let me analyze the users controller code for production readiness. I'll check
several key aspects:

Error Handling Database Operations Input Validation Security Logging Performance
Code Organization Issues I've identified:

Error Handling: Generic error messages in database operations could expose
sensitive information No specific error types for different database failures
Server errors don't have unique identifiers for tracking

Database Operations: No transaction management for critical operations No retry
mechanism for temporary database failures No connection pooling optimization

Input Validation: No validation for email format No validation for name
length/format No sanitization of input parameters No rate limiting

Security: Debug println! statement in production code No input sanitization
against SQL injection (though using Diesel ORM helps) No audit logging for
sensitive operations

Logging: Insufficient logging for critical operations No structured logging
Debug print statement instead of proper logging

Performance: No pagination in GET endpoint No caching mechanism No timeout
handling

Code Organization: Some repeated error handling code No documentation for public
API endpoints

Task Completed The code is NOT production-ready. Here are the critical issues
that need to be addressed:

Critical Issues:

## Security & Error Handling

Remove debug println! statements Implement proper structured logging for all
operations Add unique error identifiers for better tracking Implement proper
error types instead of generic server errors Sanitize and validate all inputs

## Database & Performance

[DONE] Implement connection pooling optimization Add transaction management for
data consistency Implement retry mechanism for temporary failures Add pagination
for GET endpoint to prevent large data dumps Add request timeouts Implement
caching where appropriate

## Input Validation & Business Logic

Add email format validation Add input length/format validation Implement rate
limiting Add proper input sanitization

## Monitoring & Logging

Add audit logging for sensitive operations Implement structured logging Add
performance metrics Remove debug prints

## Documentation

Add API documentation Document error scenarios and handling Add inline
documentation for complex logic The code has good basic structure but requires
significant hardening for production use. The current implementation lacks many
critical production features around security, performance, and reliability.
